        <BR>7.    Healthy adults who are at least 17 years old, and at least 110 pounds may donate about a pint of blood - the most common form of donation - every 56 days, or every two months. Females receive 53 percent of blood transfusions; males receive 47 percent.
            <BR>8.94 percent of blood donors are registered voters.
    <BR>9.        Four main red blood cell types: A, B, AB and O. Each can be positive or negative for the Rh factor. AB is the universal recipient; O negative is the universal donor of red blood cells.
<BR>10.  Dr. Karl Landsteiner first identified the major human blood groups - A, B, AB and O - in 1901.
       <BR>11.     One unit of blood can be separated into several components: red blood cells, plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate.
           <BR>12. Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's organs and tissues.
            <BR>13.Red blood cells live about 120 days in the circulatory system.
          <BR>14.  Platelets promote blood clotting and give those with leukemia and other cancers a chance to live.
          <BR>15.  Plasma is a pale yellow mixture of water, proteins and salts.
          <BR>16.  Plasma, which is 90 percent water, makes up 55 percent of blood volume.
      <BR>17.      Healthy bone marrow makes a constant supply of red cells, plasma and platelets.
     <BR>18.       Blood or plasma that comes from people who have been paid for it cannot be used to human transfusion.
            <BR>19.Granulocytes, a type of white blood cell, roll along blood vessel walls in search of bacteria to engulf and destroy.
          <BR>20.  White cells are the body's primary defense against infection.
          <BR>21.  Apheresis is a special kind of blood donation that allows a donor to give specific blood components, such as platelets.
         <BR>22.   Forty-two days: how long most donated red blood cells can be stored.
    <BR>23.        Five days: how long most donated platelets can be stored.
           <BR>24. One year: how long frozen plasma can be stored.
       <BR>25.     Much of today's medical care depends on a steady supply of blood from healthy donors.

      <BR>27.      Children being treated for cancer, premature infants and children having heart surgery need blood and platelets from donors of all types, especially type O.
        <BR>28.    Anemic patients need blood transfusions to increase their red blood cell levels.
      <BR>29.      Cancer, transplant and trauma patients, and patients undergoing open-heart surgery may require platelet transfusions to survive.
     <BR>30.       Sickle cell disease is an inherited disease that affects more than 80,000 people in the United States, 98 percent of whom are of African descent.
    <BR>31.        Many patients with severe sickle cell disease receive blood transfusions every month.
           <BR>32. A patient could be forced to pass up a lifesaving organ, if compatible blood is not available to support the transplant.
        <BR>33.    Thirteen tests (11 for infectious diseases) are performed on each unit of donated blood.
   <BR>34.         Seventeen percent of non-donors cite "never thought about it" as the main reason for not giving, while 15 percent say they're too busy.
