         Who can give blood?
    </h2>
        <p class="two"> 
            Most people can give blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.  Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:
        </p>

    <h2 class="one"> 
        Age
    </h2>
        <p class="two">
            You are aged between 18 and 65.
        
            <ul >
               <li class="one1"> 
                    In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.
                </li>
                <li class="one2">    
                    In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries are 60.
                </li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
    <h2 class="one"> 
        Weight
    </h2>
        <p class="two"> 
            You weigh at least 50 kg.   
        
            <ul>

                <li class="one1">
                       In some countries, donors of whole blood donations should weigh at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10%.
                </li> 
            </ul> 
        </p>        
    <h2 class="one">
         Health  
    </h2>

  
        <p class="two">
            You must be in good health at the time you donate.
        </p>        
        

        <p class="two"> 
            You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.
        </p>

        <p class="two"> 
            If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood after 12 hours.
        </p>

        <p class="two"> 
            If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.
        </p>

        <p class="two"> 
            You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation:
            <ul >
                <li class="one1">
                    A test will be administered at the donation site. In many countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p> 
    <h2 class="one">
         Travel
    </h2>
    </li>
        <p class="two">
             Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral.
        </p>

        <p class="two">
             Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.
        </p>

    <h2 class="one">
         Behaviours
    </h2>
        <p class="two">
             You must not give blood:
            <ul>
                <li class="one1">


                    If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months
                </li>
                <li class="one2">

                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="two">
            In the national blood donor selection guidelines, there are more behavior eligibility criteria. Criteria could be different in different countries.
        </p>

    <h2 class="one">    
        Pregnancy and breastfeeding
    </h2>
        <p class="two"> 
            Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.
        </p>

        <p class="two"> 
            It is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).
        </p>
